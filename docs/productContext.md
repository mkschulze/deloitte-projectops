## Status Workflow

### Task Lifecycle

```
┌─────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌───────────┐
│  Draft  │────▶│ Submitted │────▶│ In Review │────▶│ Approved │────▶│ Completed │
└─────────┘     └───────────┘     └─────┬─────┘     └──────────┘     └───────────┘
                      ▲                 │
                      │                 │
                      └─────────────────┘
                       (Rework Required)
```

### Multi-Reviewer Approval (NEW)

When multiple reviewers are assigned to a task:

1. **All Must Approve:** Task only transitions to "Approved" when every assigned reviewer has approved
2. **Any Can Reject:** If any single reviewer rejects, the entire task is rejected
3. **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bar shows `X/Y` reviewers approved
4. **Individual Actions:** Each reviewer has their own approve/reject buttons
5. **Audit Trail:** Each approval/rejection is logged with timestamp and optional note
